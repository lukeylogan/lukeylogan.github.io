		<p id="boobs"> I have always been the kind of person to live fully in the moment. I was never too caught up in what was going to happen or what I was going to end up doing. Which as a young adult, may not be the best quality. I never knew what I really wanted to do with my life, just that I simply wanted to live it. Once I got to college I struggled with this. I still did not know what I wanted to do, but everyone was forcing me to decide. I had a couple ideas that I might like, but none that I could dedicate my entire existence too. </p>
		<p> My sophomore year in college, I found this volunteer abroad program. GIVE, was a program that went to third world countries and aided them in any way that the country needed. I have always been interested in traveling the world, and something like this seemed like a fun idea. I went to Thailand and mostly stayed in the Northern jungles with the Hill Tribe people. These were indigenous people, technically not Thai citizens. For the next three weeks I built fresh water tanks, new roads, taught english, learned about their culture, and made life long friends. I experienced an overwhelming addiction. Once I got back to the States, I became restless and in a way lost. For those three weeks I was free from a materialistic and hedonistic state of being. I was not worried about any petty social media status or the new breaking news about another unbearable political scandal. The only thing that I was wrapped up in was living- and it was so natural. </p>
		<p> I realized that I finally found my reason of existence. I could spend my life and dedicate it to a true cause. Making the world a better place. As cliche as that idea sounds, I believe that it is the most important cause you could commit to. As our technology increases and we become more and more of a globalized power, it is important to help the other countries. The United State's is no longer only responsible for the United States. Just as other countries have more responsibilities too. If a bird disease or a mosquito disease emerge from Africa or Eastern Asia, for example, it no longer only effects those nations. It effects the entire world because of our interconnectedness. So, for me at least, making our world a better place- directly correlates to making the United States a better place. </p>
