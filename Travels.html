		<p> For the past four years, I have been traveling to some of the most beautiful places in the world. Places that most people have no idea about even the existence of such places. Clicking on the links below will show a few images of the beauty that these places encaptivate, as well as the lives that I affected during the trips. The main reason that I went to these places, were to help the local people in whatever they need help with. For the most part- in these areas, fresh water, learning english, recycling, and infrastructure building were on the top of the "list".
