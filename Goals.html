	 <p> While I have already done many incredible things in my life, I still see so much more room for expanding on it and making a "more good" world. I have been traveling to other undeveloped countries and talking with their social leaders. I've been aiming at expanding our global relief system in order to help more and more countries. I talk briefly about the factor Globalization has played in my bio page. Going further in depth on the matter, I would say that it is our responsibility as privileged people; to help out our people in need. We need to stop seeing 'them' and 'us', and embrace what it should be- 'WE'. </p>
	 <p>Within the next year, we will be expanding into two new countries! <a id="E">Ethiopia</a> and <a id="E">Taiwan</a>. Both have quite rudimentary economies and Taiwan, in particular, is not even classified as a country according to the U.S and other nations. The main thing that we will be doing in these countries will be trying to stimulate their market economy. We will be helping to start up local business and well as implement an effective managed floating economy. Trade will be embraced through supply and demand, however, in order to further help these countries; the government will be able to intervene in order to promote the interests of the country. </p>
	 <p> With doing so much to help others, one thing has remained extremely important to me. And that is simply being able to have fun. I have seen very gruesome tragedies, and also wondrous sights that leave you breathless. I think that regardless of which side of the spectrum you are enduring, it is very important to enjoy your life. Have the capability to laugh at yourself and just have fun. So I wanted to post this video to show just that.  </p>
