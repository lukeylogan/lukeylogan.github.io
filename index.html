        <h2>Wanderlust Manifesto
         </h2>
        <p>Travel- for something so arbitrary and lucid; has the potential to captivate, confuse, and change. Traveling empowers. We as people are forever pushing and advancing the confinement we placed on ourselves. As travelers of the world, we have an opportunity to break down barriers, exchange cultural knowledge, and create a positive impact on our global economy. However, through this addictive wanderlust, we play with the danger of not truly growing as individuals; and eventually, reversing our strive for global acceptance. Too often, travelers become the worst of themselves - being obnoxious to locals, demanding places to conform to their needs, and ignoring local customs. Too many travelers treat destinations as their personal hedonistic plaything. To create a better traveling environment we should follow a simple set of rules...  </p>
        <p>
        	<ul>
        		<li> I will have adequate knowledge of where I am going before I get there </li>
        		<li> I will be respectful of local cultures and customs </li>
        		<li> I will learn some phrases in the local language </li>
        		<li> I will try at least one thing that I am afraid of </li>
        		<li> I will realize that this is my privilege </li>
        		<li> I will enjoy every moment </li>
        		<li> I will embrace any sudden change of plan </li>
        		<li> I will follow my adventurous spirit </li>
        		<li> I will live and travel with fierce passion </li>
        	</ul>
